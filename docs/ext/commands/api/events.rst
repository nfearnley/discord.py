Event Reference
-----------------

These events function similar to :ref:`the regular events <discord-api-events>`, except they
are custom to the command extension module.

.. function:: on_command_error(ctx, error)

    An error handler that is called when an error is raised
    inside a command either through user input error, check
    failure, or an error in your own code.

    A default one is provided (:meth:`.Bot.on_command_error`).

    :param ctx: The invocation context.
    :type ctx: :class:`.Context`
    :param error: The error that was raised.
    :type error: :class:`.CommandError` derived

.. function:: on_command(ctx)

    An event that is called when a command is found and is about to be invoked.

    This event is called regardless of whether the command itself succeeds via
    error or completes.

    :param ctx: The invocation context.
    :type ctx: :class:`.Context`

.. function:: on_command_completion(ctx)

    An event that is called when a command has completed its invocation.

    This event is called only if the command succeeded, i.e. all checks have
    passed and the user input it correctly.

    :param ctx: The invocation context.
    :type ctx: :class:`.Context`
